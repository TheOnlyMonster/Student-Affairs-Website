This student management system is designed to help educational institutions keep track of their students' information. The system offers a variety of features that allow users to manage student data in an efficient and organized way.

One of the main features of this system is the ability to add a new student to the database. Users can enter the student's ID, name, date of birth, GPA, gender, level, status, department, email, and mobile number. This information is then stored in the local storage for easy retrieval.

Another important feature is the ability to update existing student information. Users can edit all fields except for the department field, which is disabled. This ensures that the student's department remains consistent throughout the system.

The system also allows users to delete student data through a delete button in the edit student data page. A confirmation dialogue is displayed before deletion occurs, preventing accidental deletion of important data.

Users can search for active students by name on the search for students screen. The system will render a table of students with similar names having active status. This feature helps users quickly find specific student information.

Users can assign a department to a student through the studentâ€™s department assignment page. The page includes the student's ID, name, and a dropdown list of available departments. This feature is only applicable for students with a level of 3. If the user attempts to assign a department to a student with a different level, an error message will be displayed.

The system also offers a table of all active and inactive students with a related set of attributes only. This table makes it easy for users to view all students' information in one place.

Users can change a student's status from active to inactive or vice versa from the table viewing all students. This feature allows users to quickly update a student's status without having to edit their entire profile.

Finally, the system has a well-designed navigation bar that allows users to move through all pages and a home page. This navigation bar makes it easy for users to access all features of the system quickly.

Overall, this student management system provides a comprehensive solution for managing student information. Its many features make it easy for educational institutions to keep track of their students' information in an efficient and organized way.
